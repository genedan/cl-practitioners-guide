The Chainladder Ecosystem
=========================

Chainladder's open-source license, along with its transparent API, not only encourages users to enhance the quality
of its existing features, but also enables them to extend the package with new features and to use it as a dependency
in downstream applications. This section will highlight the nascent, but growing involvement of the actuarial community,
along with new projects that have emerged since Chainladder's inception.

Community Effort
----------------

Since @jbogaardt's initial commit on June 14, 2017, the Chainladder repository has undergone significant development, amassing over 1,400 commits contributed by 19 distinct individuals. This collaborative effort has resulted in a dynamic project, with new versions released every 3 to 6 months on average. Currently, the project boasts 75 released versions, with the latest iteration, v0.8.20, launched on April 10, 2024.

The project's vitality is further evidenced by the acceptance and merging of 158 pull requests and the active engagement of the community in issue reporting. Over 250 issues have been raised collectively, with more than 230 of them successfully addressed and resolved. This responsiveness to community feedback has fostered a positive reception, as demonstrated by the 173 stars received on the @casact GitHub community, positioning Chainladder as one of the most acclaimed packages in the whole actuarial community, including non-Property and Casualty practices.

The success of Chainladder can be attributed in part to its presence on GitHub, a widely accessible software development platform. Leveraging the platform's visibility, actuarial practitioners and other stakeholders with an interest in open-source software have organically contributed to its growth and refinement.

The transparency afforded by GitHub, coupled with its social-media functionalities, has facilitated global discussions among developers, enabling them to collaboratively enhance the package's quality. By embedding itself within the broader open-source ecosystem, Chainladder remains adaptable, continuously evolving to address the evolving needs of both business and technology.

Downstream Projects
-------------------
Here are well known projects that depend on chainladder-python.

Tryangle by Balona and Richman
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tryangle is an automatic chainladder reserving framework. It provides scoring and optimization methods based on machine learning techniques to automatically select optimal parameters to minimise reserve prediction error. Key features include optimising loss development factors, choosing between multiple IBNR models, or optimially blending these models.

FASLR: Free Actuarial System for Loss Reserving by Dan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FASLR is a graphical user interface that uses Chainladder as its core reserving engine. It is intended to extend the
functionality of Chainladder by enabling the user to conduct reserve studies via interactive menus, screens, and mouse
clicks. It is built on top of a relational database, adding the ability to store and retrieve the results LDF and ultimate selections.
