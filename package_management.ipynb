    "Reserve studies apply algorithms to manipulate data. These algorithms can be written as Excel formulas, as a sequence of statements in a script, a collection of functions and classes in a package, or in a variety of other ways. The aim of this section is to promote the organization of these algorithms into packages, of which both the R and Python versions of Chainladder are examples. We will start by following what an actuary interested in applying programming on the job might do as they begin to learn their language of preference, by applying simple Python statements to an input triangle. We will then describe the problems the actuary may face when doing so and the motivations towards organizing their code into higher levels of abstraction - that is, functions, classes, and packages - designed to solve such problems."

    "\n",
    "As a project increases in scope and visibility, there will be a time when the maintainer will need to share code with others or invite others to work on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reasons for sharing code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Promote visibility within or beyond their organization\n",
    "- Need to grant access to other departments, such as IT to assist in deployment and maintenance\n",
    "- The project scope has grown so that more people need to be core contributors, such as new direct reports in an expanding team\n",

    "## Non-recommended Methods for Sharing Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The following methods for sharing code are not recommended but may have been used in the past prior to the rise of repository hosting providers. Because these methods are not optimal and come with many downsides, but can still be used to share code, it may be difficult to convince IT or upper management to provide proper tools or adopt industry best practices (source control hosted on a repository provider), since you may be told that as long these get the job done, you will need to put up with whatever inconveniences they may carry. Our goal is to clearly articulate these downsides in the hopes that you can overcome the communicative barrier at work.\n",

    "Why you shouldn't share code this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Companies may forbid attachments with certain code extensions (.py, .R).\n",
    "- If you shared your code and latter make an update, you will need to send a new file. If your colleague also made their own update, they will need to manually inspect your new version and their version and hope that they didn't make any errors in doing so.\n",

    "\n",
    "Perhaps you've gotten your department to adopt version control and have also been provided a shared drive to place your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why you shouldn't share code this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poor integration with project management software: As a project grows in size, you will want start using tools to manage the project. This includes things like issue tracking, CI/CD, and automated testing. There are well-known commercial products such as GitHub, Azure DevOps, and Atlassian which provide such features out-of-the box, in addition to hosting code repositories on either an on-premises server or in the cloud. \n",
    "- Merge conflicts: Leaving an editable set of code on a shared drives opens the possibility of having uncommitted edits if people choose to edit the shared drive version of the code rather than locally and then pushing their code to a centralized hosting provider. This type of workflow will lead to conflicting versions of code across team members, which will be extremely difficult to reconcile if the project is large.\n",

    "### Physical Media\n",
    "\n",
    "At this time of writing, we would find this situation to be rare, but you never know. It is common for companies to lock down the ability of their employees to put data onto physical media for security reasons, such as protecting data and intellectual property. For this reason alone, attempting to share code this way is not recommended. Another reason would be the inconvenience of physical media compared to Intra-/Internet transfer capabilities that we would hope would exist at most companies.\n",
